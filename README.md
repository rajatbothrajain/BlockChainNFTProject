# BlockChainNFTProject

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are digital assets that are stored on the blockchain, making them unique and non-transferable. As NFTs become more widespread, many businesses are developing new market segments that include NFTs. This project aims to provide a web application that allows users to log into MetaMask, access, fetch, and then select an NFT to submit to Lamose, a company that can personalize water bottles, for engraving on a bottle. Using the user's public key, the web application will retrieve the user's NFT image(s) from the NFT marketplace.The NFT metadata will be then sent to a Blockchain-based chat application. Finally, the application will use a smart contract to send a message to Lamose, making the entire application decentralized.
