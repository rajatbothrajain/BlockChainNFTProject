# BlockChainNFTProject

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are digital assets that are stored on the blockchain, making them unique and non-transferable. As NFTs become more widespread, many businesses are developing new market segments that include NFTs. This project aims to provide a web application that allows users to log into MetaMask, access, fetch, and then select an NFT to submit to Lamose, a company that can personalize water bottles, for engraving on a bottle. Using the user's public key, the web application will retrieve the user's NFT image(s) from the NFT marketplace.The NFT metadata will be then sent to a Blockchain-based chat application. Finally, the application will use a smart contract to send a message to Lamose, making the entire application decentralized.

## Getting Started :
This application is divided into 3 Components :
1) NFTServer : Responsible For Providing the NFTs details associated with the particular wallet address.
2) ClientGUI : GUI application designed to be used by the clients of lamose. Provides option of selecting and sending NFTs
3) LamoseGUI : GUI application created to view the NFTs engraving request received from the clients/customers.

Used rinkeby test network for development and testing as it is free and provides similar functionalities same as Ethereum Mainnet 


In order to run the complete application all of the above 3 Components needs to be setup on the machine.
